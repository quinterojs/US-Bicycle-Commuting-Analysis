# US-Bike-Commuting-Analysis

The U.S. Department of Transportation recently partnered with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Public Health Association (APHA) to release data on transportation and public health indicators for each U.S. state and metropolitan area. The purpose of the data release, available via the Transportation and Health Tool (THT), is to provide practitioners with data that they can use to help improve transportation decision making.

The purpose of this study is to perform exploratory data analysis on the publicly released dataset, with the overall objective of teasing out relationships between bicycle commuting and public health in the United States.
